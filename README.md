Pet Pose
========

**Does your pet pose like a human?**

Drop a photo of your pet (or another animal, or whatever you like really) onto the page. Their pose will be estimated using [PoseNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet), a [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow) model, and displayed on top of the photo.

PoseNet has been trained on images of humans, so it's probably not going to do so well with your pet, unless they've pulled a particularly lifelike human pose!

[Here is more info on running PoseNet in the browser](https://medium.com/tensorflow/real-time-human-pose-estimation-in-the-browser-with-tensorflow-js-7dd0bc881cd5).
